# wave-sfa

Check our [website](http://kkdey.github.io/wave-sfa) to track development on this project.

This repository is aimed at using wavelet transform in 

- Sparse factor analysis/ Penalized matrix decomposition problems
- Topic models with ordered variables in clustering
- Variable Selection 
- Recovering time order for smooth-varying functions (related to cell cycle).

This repository will also be connected to the repository [singleCell-method](https://github.com/jhsiao999/singleCell-method), a joint project with Joyce Hsiao,  for applications related to single cell methods.
